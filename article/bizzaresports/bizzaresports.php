            <p>Finns are special people with strange tastes.
			They enjoy salty liquorice after all.
			At first glance, they can be a little cold and serious,
			but you will discover that they have an excellent sense of humor.
			Take a look at the unusual sporting events that draw thousands
			of spectators and contestants every year! Here’s a round-up of
			a few. 
            </p>

            <h2>Go on the mud ! 
            </h2>

            <p>The top Finnish cross-country skiers were
			training in the mud in summer to be in perfect condition 
			on their cross-country skis once winter came. They thought
			it would be more fun to associate these painful training methods
			with the most universally shared fun activity, football.
			They organize the first football mud championship in 1998
			in Hyrynsalmi. The Swamp Soccer was born.</p>

			<p>Christiano Ronaldo’s technical subtleties will not be
			of much use here. The field is a swamp, there are no offside 
			rules but as usual, the one with the most goals wins. Okay,
			now you're ready for the World Football Championships in the
			swamps of Hyrynsalmi in northeastern Finland. Be careful not 
			to lose your boots in the mud... 
            </p>

			<h2>Ready, Steady, Go!</h2>
            <p>If you like to get dirty but you don’t
			like football you can try the Wife Carrying! 
			This "discipline" dates back 
			to the 19th century if we believe the legend.
			A local bandit named Ronkainen used to rob women 
			and bring them home by carrying them on his back.
			One act replicates each year since 1990 by the couples
			competing at the world championships organized in Sonkajärvi
			in ​​Eastern Finland.
			</p>
			
			<p>The legend of this brigand has been honored since 1990
			at the World Women's Wear Championship. Participating men
			must make a special run with a woman on their back. 
			The official circuit, which stretches 253.5 meters, 
			takes them into the water, sand, grass and gravel.
			Different obstacles also stand in their way. 
			The winner is of course the fastest couple.
			</p>
			
			<p>As a man, it is obviously necessary to have a woman
			to carry to participate in the competition of wife carrying .
			This woman does not necessary have to be the wife or companion 
			of the man. Her minimum weight must reach 49 kilos. 
			When her weight is lower, she must wear a backpack
			to reach 49 kilos. When the woman falls off his back,
			the couple must take 15 seconds penalty.
            </p>

            <h2>Throw it away! </h2>

            <p> Don’t know what to do with your old Nokia? 
			We have a little idea for you, show him who is the
			boss and try to throw it to the moon! 
			This is the only sport where you can throw 
			all the frustrations caused by these modern equipments away.
			</p>
			
			<p>The mobile phone throwing started in Savonlinna 
			in Finland. The company Fennolingua was in partnership
			with local recycling centers and they created a championship 
			tournament.
			</p>
			
			<p>The championship participants compete in four main categories:
			the over-the-shoulder throw where you have to throw it as far as
			you can; the "freestyle" category where everything is a matter of
			aesthetics and creativity and the team category, where three
			teammates have one throw each and their scores are added together.
			Finally, there is the junior category, reserved for 
			kids under 12 years. 
			Beyond the bizarre sport, the organizers insist on the
			environmental vocation of the competition, 
			all phones are recycled at the end of the competition. 
            </p>
			<h2>Just try it!</h2>
			<p>These sports gain a lot of popularity and now many 
			countries organize their own championships.
			The global interest turned it into an international sport! 
			If you are in Finland, try to attend or participate, 
			it will be a good story to tell to your friends !
