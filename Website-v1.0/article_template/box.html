<p class="articleBody">You might wonder how does one get into flipping? I can’t answer for everyone, but in my case, I always loved knives. Since I was little, weapons, and knives in particular, have fascinated me. While my collection was growing, one or two balisongs made it into it. I remember when I had just received one of them. As soon as we came out of the store I took the knife out of the paper bag and started trying flippi-… aaand I cut myself in the first two minutes of owning it. It was a deep cut but nothing bad.</br>
  Since then, I tried flipping from time to time but never anything serious. At some point I think I got a semblance of a figure together… It’s only more recently that I started really digging into the world of knives. Where before was a strong interest and love, appeared a furious passion. I became interested in every single detail of the knife world: from the technical details such as steels and characteristics, the forging process, all the way to the artistic details, the people behind each model, the types of knives and more…

  It’s only natural then, that at some point I stumbled upon a video of balisong flipping. Then another. Then another one. And another one. I became hypnotized. It made me want to try these tricks, learn complex figures to be able to do them myself. I dug out my trusty butterfly, the one that cut me many years ago, and started practicing. It was good enough to kickstart my new-found hobby, but it was way too clunky and clumsy. I did some research but buying this kind of blade in France was much harder and more expensive than in the USA. Then, by some weird turn of events, while traveling, I found in a small historical town on the west coast of France named Guérande, a knife that was not too bad and for only 4 euros! I started practicing moves I already learned and mastering new ones. It was much better than the old one, although nowadays I’m thinking about investing in a new one.</br>
  I would really recommend trying this out at least once. Just while writing this article I taught a friend a new figure, while the others watched with interest. Some of them already tried it a little bit, just to see what it felt like. There are no obligations, but the adrenaline rush is quite enjoyable, and you get a real sense of accomplishment when you successfully pull of a new move. If you’d rather stay away from knives and watch from a distance, do just that! Watch a couple of videos on the Internet, if you get the chance to see someone in real life, do not miss it! Although I would be really jealous since I haven’t seen a professional in real life as of yet!</br>
